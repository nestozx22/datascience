```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```




```{r cars}
if(!require(readr)) {install.packages("readr")}
library("readr")


df_cyber_brechas <- read_csv("Cyber Security Breaches.csv")
problems(df_cyber_brechas)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
